# MyReads App

React app for listing books that you are interested in.

Built on top of the [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com). 

## Quickstart

1. Clone the repo
2. cd into the project root and run `npm install`
3. run `npm start`

If you follow those steps the app should open in your default browser.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results. 

## create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This is an exam project for the React Nanodegree at Udacity so it won't make sense to accept contributions.
